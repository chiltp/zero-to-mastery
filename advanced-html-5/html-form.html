    <h2>HTML Form</h2>
    <p>An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.</p>

    <h4>The Name Attribute for &lt;input&gt;</h4>
    <p>Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted. If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.</p>
    <!--Example as above-->
    <p style="background-color:antiquewhite;">The "name" attribute serves two primary purposes:
        <ol>
            <li>Grouping: By giving radio buttons the same "name" attribute, you specify that they belong to a common group. In this case, all the radio buttons with the "name" attribute set to "fav_language" are part of the same group.</li>
            <li>Selection Limitation: The "name" attribute ensures that only one radio button in the group can be selected at a time. When a user selects one option, it automatically deselects any other radio button with the same "name" attribute within the group.</li>
        </ol>
