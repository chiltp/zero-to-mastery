    <h1>HTML vs HTML 5</h1>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is used for structuring and presenting content on the web. While HTML5 builds upon the previous versions of HTML, it also introduces new features, enhancements, and improvements. Here are some key differences between HTML and HTML5:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Doctype declaration: HTML documents require a Document Type Declaration (DTD) to specify the version of HTML being used. In HTML, the doctype declaration is typically <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. HTML5 introduced a simplified and standardized doctype declaration, which is just <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, making it easier to start an HTML document.</li><br>
        <li>New elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements to provide better structure and meaning to the content. These include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, and more. These elements help developers create more accessible and well-organized web pages.</li><br>
        <li>Audio and video support: HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages, using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements. This eliminates the need for external plugins like Flash and enables seamless playback across different devices and platforms.</li><br>
        <li>Form enhancements: HTML5 introduced several new form input types and attributes that simplify form handling and improve user experience. Examples include <code>&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code>, and more. HTML5 also introduced form validation features, such as the required attribute and built-in form validation through JavaScript.</li>
