    <h1>Some tips from freeCodeCamp</h1>
    <h2>1. Make dead links using the hash symbol</h2>
    <p>Using the hash symbol when you want to create placeholders for links that don't have an actual destination or are not yet implemented.</p>
    <!--Example as below-->
    <a href="#">Click here</a>
    <p>The href attribute is set to "#" to represent an empty URL or a link that doesn't lead anywhere. When the user clicks on the link, nothing will happen or change in the page because the link is effectively dead.</p>

    <h2>2. Link to internal sections of a page with Anchor elements</h2>
