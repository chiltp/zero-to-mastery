        <h1>History of the Web</h1>
        <h2>1. WWW vs Internet</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Internet: The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices. It began in the late 1960s as a project called ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Its purpose was to establish a robust and decentralized communication network that could withstand partial failures. Over time, it evolved into the vast network we know today, connecting billions of devices worldwide.</li>
            <li>World Wide Web (WWW): The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the web, is a system of interconnected webpages and resources accessible via the internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s while working at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. Berners-Lee envisioned a way to link and share information globally, leading to the development of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the first web browser.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In simple terms, the internet is the underlying infrastructure or network that connects computers and devices worldwide, while the World Wide Web is an application or service built on top of the internet that allows users to access and navigate webpages through browsers.</p>
        <h2>2. HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML was created in the early 1990s by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.</li>
                    <li>It was designed as a markup language to structure and present content on webpages.</li>
                    <li>HTML uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</li>
                    <li>The initial version was HTML 1.0, followed by HTML 2.0, 3.2, 4.01, and eventually HTML5, which is the current version.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS was developed in the late 1990s by a group of web designers and browser vendors.</li>
                    <li>It was created to separate the presentation (style) of webpages from the content (HTML).</li>
                    <li>CSS allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of webpages.</li>
                    <li>CSS1 and CSS2 were introduced, and then CSS3, which is the latest version and includes advanced styling capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications.</li>
                    <li>It was developed as a scripting language to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript allows developers to create interactive features like image sliders, form validations, and responsive designs.</li>
                    <li>Over time, JavaScript evolved, and ECMAScript (the official specification) introduced new versions, such as ES5, ES6 (ES2015), and subsequent yearly releases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>3. Developer History</h2>
        <p>In 2000s, a full stack developer learnt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FE: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + JQuery</li>
            <li>BE: Apache Server (PHP), Database (MySQL)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nowadays, a full stack developer is learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript + React</li>
            <li>BE: Node Server (Node.js, Express.js), Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)</li>
        </ul>
