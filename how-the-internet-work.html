            <li>User accesses a web browser (desktop web browser/ mobile web browser), types an URL Google.com into the location bar and hits Enter.</li>
            <li>We ask a question who's this Google.com fellow? And that question gets asked all the way down to our ISP - Internet Service Provider.</li>
            <li>IPS gets that request and they send that off to something called the DNS - Domain Name Service. Essentially it's a phone book has the list of all these URLs like Google.com and the addresses of them.</li>
            <li>DNS sends off that request back through the ISP and the website or the web browser, Google Chrome in this case gets "172.217.7.23" - an IP address.</li>
        <img src="/image/how-the-internet-work-2.png" height="150">
            <li>The browser receives this IP address, then sends off another request to the Google servers.</li>
            <li>Google servers send text files (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to the browser and the browser will render and display the HTML content, and execute scripts (if have).</li>
